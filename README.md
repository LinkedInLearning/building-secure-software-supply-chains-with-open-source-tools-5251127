## Course Description

This course is designed for security engineers, developers, and DevOps teams who want to lock down their software supply chains against modern threats. Learn to secure every phase of the development (from code to deployment) using practical, open-source tools like Syft (for SBOMs), Grype (vulnerability scanning for SBOMs), Trivy (dependency checks) and Gitleaks (secrets detection). Instructor Oladele Oloruntimilehin explains how to build automated, parallelized pipelines that cut runtime while maintaining rigorous security checks. By the end, you will have a repeatable workflow to prevent breaches, comply with industry standards, and ship code with confidence.
